Recently, numerous swarm-based algorithms are proposed which includes the artifiial bee colony, bat-inspired method , flower pollination set of rules, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) , etc. A successful and effctive swarm-based totally set of rules that these days proposed to imitate the searching conduct of the grey wolves is the so-known as GWO.It revive the social behaviors of gray wolves in the elements in their hierarchical management and searching maneuver.

A Meta-heuristics algorithm, Grey Wolf optimizer is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. It revives the hunting technique and social hierarchy of grey wolves in the environment. Wolves generally really like to live in a pack. The gathering size is 5-12 by and large. Exceptionally compelling is that they have an extremely severe social predominant progressive system. In the grey wolf algorithm, wolves are splits into four levels: α wolf, β wolf, δ wolf, and ω wolf.
