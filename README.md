Recently, numerous swarm-based algorithms are proposed which includes the artifiial bee colony, bat-inspired method , flower pollination set of rules, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) , etc. A successful and effctive swarm-based totally set of rules that these days proposed to imitate the searching conduct of the grey wolves is the so-known as GWO.It revive the social behaviors of gray wolves in the elements in their hierarchical management and searching maneuver.

A Meta-heuristics algorithm, Grey Wolf optimizer is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. It revives the hunting technique and social hierarchy of grey wolves in the environment. Wolves generally really like to live in a pack. The gathering size is 5-12 by and large. Exceptionally compelling is that they have an extremely severe social predominant progressive system. In the grey wolf algorithm, wolves are splits into four levels: α wolf, β wolf, δ wolf, and ω wolf.

They use three hunting strategies: 
- Encircling prey
- Hunting prey
- Attacking prey

## GWO-ELM classification
Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a swift learning technique for the single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks. ELM has low complexity and fast training speed. Even so, as a few parameters of ELM are random, the accuracy cannot b e assured. In this segment, Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm is used to calculate the parameters of ELM to enhance the prediction accuracy. It is p erceptible that the GWO algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters in ELM, which aid in obtaining the optimal network.

Here the GWO set of rules is used to train the enter parameters of the ELM to swell its accuracy and to reduce the unwell-circumstance problem. GWO algorithm used to choose the hidden layer parameters like bias and weights values to escalate the performance of ELM.
